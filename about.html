    Hi, my name is Iris Ma, an Ithaca-based architectural designer and the owner of Mud & Tail - a small ceramic studio tucked away in the woods of upstate New York. My work is inspired by the wild foliages and forest friends surrounding my home studio: bunnies, flying squirrels, actual squirrels, foxies, deer, groundhogs, birds, etc. I am passionate about capturing these tiny doses of joy with clay in my work. They make me "awww" and I hope they make you "awww" as well.
